We know that due to the current circumstances, we have to sadly leave the active work slightly behind and do some desk working first. As a result, we decided to write a review the literature to see what is going on in this discipline.\nYou may have noticed that we are writing a literature review but systematically writing it. What is the difference? Compared to the convential literature review where most authors cite articles and books as per their purpose, a systematic review is written in a more objective way:  1) formulating questions according to the protocol  2) showing including and excluding criteria before filtering relevant studies  3) evaluate the quality of the selected studies\nWe understand that by doing a systematic review will enable us maximum information with minimally biased criteria with courtesy to the protocol. Also the transparency is another imporant asset to that.\nWe set our research aim to identify and analyse the main components of under-represented participants in various VGI projects and the outlook to encourage diverse participation in future geospatial crowdsourcing. The main question is shown below:\n\nDoes the contribution of under-represented volunteers (participants) more likely to create diverse outcomes in VGI projects when compared with the socially biased environment?\n\nWe have set our research objective and questions, and are currently documenting our selection criteria that looks something like this document (follow link).\nSlides\nWe would be delighted to share more of our current work and receive feedback.\nYou can click Present button in the slide below or simply follow the link (visit URL).\n\n\n\n\nPlease have a look at the slides for more details and let us know if you have any questions.\n\n\n\n",
