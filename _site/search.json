These solutions are based on the mindset that considers the bias, missingness, or low quality as a useful source of data to make inference about the underlying reasons for the missingness and bias. One application of this is extracting the 3D map of cities using the patterns of blockage, reflection, and attenuation of the GPS signals (or other similar signals), that are contributed by the volunteers/crowd.\nResearchers\nMr.¬†Terrence Lines\n\n\n\nüìß: Terrence.Lines@glasgow.ac.uk  üê¶: lines_terry  üè¶: University Page\nTerence Lines joined our team in 2018.\nTerry‚Äôs research interests are the use of low quality spatial data for inference about urban environments. Many new forms of data are crowdsourced or automatically collected without controls on quality. Both theoretical and applied methods are required in order to measure uncertainty and make inferences. In particular, Terry is interested in techniques to combine overlapping poor quality but independent data sources to investigate the environmental processes leading to data creation through the use of statistical models and weakly-supervised machine learning techniques.\nDr.¬†Hyesop Shin\n\n\n\nüìß: Hyesop.Shin@glasgow.ac.uk  üê¶: hyesop  üè¶: University Page\nHyesop Shin joined our team in 2020.\nHyesop is a quantitative geographer interested in themes including environmental hazards, urban air quality, individual mobility patterns, which are likely to be real-world problems. To tackle these issues, Hyesop applies methods including GIScience and agent-based modelling (ABM). Prior to joining Glasgow, Hyesop completed his PhD at the University of Cambridge where he looked at how individuals exposure to air pollution can differ by commuting routes and socioeconomic backgrounds using an agent-based simulation. At Glasgow, Hyesop‚Äôs current project unravels the benefits of using crowdsourcing to help improve our understanding of locational services for the under-represented groups.\nPh.D Students\n\n\n\n",
